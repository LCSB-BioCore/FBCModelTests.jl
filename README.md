A collection of tests for constraint-based metabolic models.

There are currently 2 main test suites implemented:

- [FROG reproducibility and curation checks](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/curation/fbc)
- [Memote](https://memote.readthedocs.io/)-style model consistency and annotation checks

## FROG

You can generate FROG reports using function `frog_generate_report` and compare
the "compatibility" of two reports using `frog_compare_reports`. See the inline
documentation for more details.

The supposed workflow with FROG reports is the following:
- If you are a model author, you generate a FROG report that is used as a
  reference solution of your metabolic model problem, and distribute it along a
  model.
- If you are a model curator, you demand the FROG report from the original
  author as a "certificate" of their model's intended functionality.
- If you use a model of someone other, you generate another FROG report with
  your analysis software, and then compare the report against the original
  model author's report to verify that your software is interpreting the model
  information correctly and that the solutions are compatible within a
  reasonable tolerance.

The implementation is based off the description of the [EBI's FBC curation
site](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/curation/fbc), with some details
following the decisions in the [`fbc_curation` Python
tool](https://github.com/matthiaskoenig/fbc_curation) (working with [COBRApy](https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy/)) by
Matthias König ([@matthiaskoenig](https://github.com/matthiaskoenig)).

## Memote-style tests

This package exposes a number of tests aimed at quickly checking if certain
basic quality characteristics of a constraint-based metabolic model are
satisfied. Assuming your model will work with the default configuration
arguments of the test functions (see their docstrings), then you can test your
model with:

```
using FBCModelTests
using COBREXA, Tulip, Test

model = load_model("e_coli_core.json")

run_tests(model, Tulip.Optimizer; config = Config.memote_config)

model_info = generate_memote_report(model, optimizer; config = Config.memote_config)
```
You can set the configuration parameters through adjusting `Config.memote_config`,
which is a type of `MemoteConfig` and exported by default. Note, some of the
original Memote tests involve solving MILPs. These tests are not included in
this package as the issues they identify are often easier to identify by simpler
means. For example, finding stoichiometrically inconsistent metabolites is
simpler done by just checking the mass balance around each reaction.
