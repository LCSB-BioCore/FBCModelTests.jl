Iterates through all the reactions in `model` and checks if the charges across
each reaction balance. Returns a list of reaction IDs that are charge
unbalanced, which is empty if the test passes.

Optionally, use `config.consistency.mass_ignored_reactions` to pass a vector
of reaction ids to ignore in this process. Internally biomass and exchang
reactions are ignored.

"""
$(TYPEDSIGNATURES)

Determines if the model is stoichiometrically consistent. Note, stoichiometric
consistency does not guarantee that mass balances must hold in the model. A more
robust check is [`reactions_mass_unbalanced`](@ref), but this works if not all
metabolites have mass assigned to them.

Based on Gevorgyan, Albert, Mark G. Poolman, and David A. Fell. "Detection of
stoichiometric inconsistencies in biomolecular models." Bioinformatics (2008).

Optionally ignore some reactions in this analysis by adding reaction IDs to
`config.consistency.consistency_ignored_reactions`.

    Note, there is a MILP method that can be used to find the unconserved metabolite,
    but the problem is a MILP (and probably why the original MEMOTE takes so long to run).

    Note, it may be better to add additional constraints on the model to ensure that mass
    cannot be create (through lower and upper bounds on m). This is to prevent things like:
    A -> x*B -> C where x can be anything. This test will not catch these kinds of errors.
