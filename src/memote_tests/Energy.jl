$(TYPEDSIGNATURES)

Attempts to detect if the `model` contains any erroneous energy generating
cycles by closing all exchange reactions and using flux balance analysis to
maximize the sum of fluxes through a set of energy dissipating reactions. The
flux sum should be zero if the model is free of energy generating reactions.

This function is based on Fritzemeier, Claus Jonathan, et al. "Erroneous
energy-generating cycles in published genome scale metabolic networks:
Identification and removal." PLoS computational biology (2017).

The energy dissipating reactions are based on the source paper, and include:
```
ATP + H2O --> ADP + H + Phosphate
CTP + H2O --> CDP + H + Phosphate
GTP + H2O --> GDP + H + Phosphate
UTP + H2O --> UDP + H + Phosphate
ITP + H2O --> IDP + H + Phosphate
NADH --> H + NAD
NADPH --> H + NADP
FADH2 --> 2 H + FAD
FMNH2 --> 2 H + FMN
Ubiquinol-8 --> 2 H + Ubiquinone-8
Menaquinol-8 --> 2 H + Menaquinone-8
2-Demethylmenaquinol-8 --> 2 H + 2-Demethylmenaquinone-8
H2O + ACCOA --> H + Acetate + COA
L-Glutamate + H2O --> 2-Oxoglutarate + Ammonium + 2 H
H[external] --> H
```
Additional energy dissipating reactions can be directly specified through
`config.energy.additional_energy_generating_reactions`, which should be
vector of COBREXA `Reaction`s using the same metabolite name space as the
`model`. Internally, the `model` is converted to a COBREXA `StandardModel`, so
ensure that the appropriate accessors are defined for it.

Since models use different name spaces,
`config.energy.energy_dissipating_metabolites` is used to create the
energy dissipating reactions. By default it uses the BiGG name space, but this
will be changed to ChEBI in due course. If your model uses a different name
space, then you have to change the values (NOT the keys) of
`config.energy.energy_dissipating_metabolites`. Each energy dissipating
reaction is added to the test only if all its associated metabolites are
present. Any `config.energy.optimizer_modifications` to the solver are
passed directly through to COBREXA's `flux_balance_analysis` function. All
`config.energy.boundary_reactions` and
`config.energy.ignored_energy_reactions` are deleted from an internal
copy of `model`; this internal copy is used for analysis.

Returns `true` if the model has no energy generating cycles.
