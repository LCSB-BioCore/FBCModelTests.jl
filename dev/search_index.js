The flux sum should be zero if the model is free of energy generating reactions.\n\nThis function is based on Fritzemeier, Claus Jonathan, et al. \"Erroneous energy-generating cycles in published genome scale metabolic networks: Identification and removal.\" PLoS computational biology (2017).\n\nThe energy dissipating reactions are based on the source paper, and include:\n\nATP + H2O --> ADP + H + Phosphate\nCTP + H2O --> CDP + H + Phosphate\nGTP + H2O --> GDP + H + Phosphate\nUTP + H2O --> UDP + H + Phosphate\nITP + H2O --> IDP + H + Phosphate\nNADH --> H + NAD\nNADPH --> H + NADP\nFADH2 --> 2 H + FAD\nFMNH2 --> 2 H + FMN\nUbiquinol-8 --> 2 H + Ubiquinone-8\nMenaquinol-8 --> 2 H + Menaquinone-8\n2-Demethylmenaquinol-8 --> 2 H + 2-Demethylmenaquinone-8\nH2O + ACCOA --> H + Acetate + COA\nL-Glutamate + H2O --> 2-Oxoglutarate + Ammonium + 2 H\nH[external] --> H\n\nAdditional energy dissipating reactions can be directly specified through additional_energy_generating_reactions, which should be vector of COBREXA Reactions using the same metabolite name space as the model. Internally, the model is converted to a COBREXA StandardModel, so ensure that the appropriate accessors are defined for it.\n\nSince models use different name spaces, energy_dissipating_metabolites is used to create the energy dissipating reactions. By default it uses the BiGG name space, but this will be changed to ChEBI in due course. If your model uses a different name space, then you have to change the values (NOT the keys) of energy_dissipating_metabolites. Each energy dissipating reaction is added to the test only if all its associated metabolites are present. Any modifications to the solver are passed directly through to COBREXA's flux_balance_analysis function. All boundary_reactions and ignore_reactions are deleted from an internal copy of model; this internal copy is used for analysis.\n\nReturns true if the model has energy generating cycles.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"functions/#FBCModelTests.is_consistent-Tuple{Any, Any}","page":"Reference","title":"FBCModelTests.is_consistent","text":"is_consistent(\n    model,\n    optimizer;\n    boundary_reactions,\n    ignored_reactions\n) -> Bool\n\n\nDetermines if the model is stiochiometrically consistent. Note, stoichiometric consistency does not guarantee that mass balances must hold in the model. A more robust check is is_model_mass_balanced, but this works if not all metabolites have mass assigned to them.\n\nBased on Gevorgyan, Albert, Mark G. Poolman, and David A.
